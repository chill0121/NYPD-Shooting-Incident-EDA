## Setup 

We will first begin by loading in the packages we intend to use. 

Then, importing the data using a URL directly from the source. 
This ensures we will capture updates to the data as they come in whenever we run this again.

```{r Setup RMD}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)

import_URL <- read.csv("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD")
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Let's take a look at the dimension of this imported data.frame as well as the variable types of each column.
```{r EDA}
dim(import_URL)
str(import_URL)
```
